Thanks for stopping by!

I'm a researcher with background in human geography, information management and epidemiology.

I'm currently part of IeDEA-SA team at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine University of Bern. I'm an epidemiologist and statistician supporting various projects tackling problems of healthcare delivery and patient outcomes among persons living with HIV.
