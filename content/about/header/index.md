<!-- this is a subheadline -->

Thanks for stopping by!

I'm a postdoctoral researcher with background in human geography, information management and epidemiology.

I'm currently part of the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS Southern Africa (IeDEA-SA) collaboration at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Bern. I'm an epidemiologist and statistician supporting various projects tackling problems of healthcare delivery and patient outcomes among persons living with HIV.
