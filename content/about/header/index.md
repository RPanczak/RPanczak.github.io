I'm a postdoctoral researcher with background in human geography, demography, information management and epidemiology.

I'm currently part of the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS collaboration at the University of Bern. I work as an epidemiologist and statistician supporting various projects tackling problems of healthcare delivery and patient outcomes among persons living with HIV.
