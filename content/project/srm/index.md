## Estimating temporary populations

![Tempo](tempo.png)

My latest systematic review was conducted within the TEMPO project at the University of Queensland. Sifting over 20 thousands publications we selected 96 that captured wide variety of methods used to estimate temporary populations. This offers a snapshot of dynamic and changing field with novel methods and data sources radically changing our understanding of dynamics of human activity. We kept the review up to date until the date of publication following ideas of living systematic review. In a truly open scientific spirit all methods nd materials are available [online](https://github.com/RPanczak/TEMPO_syst-rev).    

## Association between mental health-related stigma and active help-seeking

My second contribution to systematising knowledge was a methodological support of Nina Schnyder's work that aimed at estimating the impact of four stigma types (help-seeking attitudes and personal, self and perceived public stigma) on active help-seeking in the general population. Data and code are available on [OSF](https://osf.io/drb7v/).    

## Homicide-suicides compared to homicides and suicides

In my first encounter with systematic reviews and meta analysis I contributed to work led by Michael Geissb√ºhler where we examined studies comparing perpetrators of homicide-suicides with perpetrators of simple homicides and suicides. This work identified characteristic that differed between individuals involved and we also examined the proportion of firearm use and its correlation with firearm availability between different countries.
